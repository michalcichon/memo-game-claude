# 🧠 LLM Vibe-Coded Memory Game — Claude Version

This repository contains the version of the **vibe-coded memory game** generated by **Claude** as part of my experiment with large language models.

The goal of the project was to see how far current LLMs can go when building a small but complete project with minimal human intervention.  
Here, Claude was tasked with creating a classic browser-based memory game based only on natural language instructions — no manual coding involved.
